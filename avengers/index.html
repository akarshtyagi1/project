            Since it's your birthday, we thought of making something cool! We were really confused, what should we give you? Sorry if you don't like this gift but as we all know you love handmade gifts , so this one is really a very not so well baked gift. So here we go with the friends part.
            AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

            Now you have to guess which message is sent by whom.
            This was a small token of love from all the people around you , who love you beyond infinity...
            This is the best thing we could think of during this pandemic time. Hope you enjoyed as much as we did while making it.
            Once again Many Many Happy Returns of the day
